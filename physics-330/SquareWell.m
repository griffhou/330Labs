function [x,psi,E] = SquareWell(n,a,NPoints)
% Calculate the energy and wavefunction for an
% electron in an infinite square well
%
% Inputs: n is the energy level; must be a positive integer
% a is the well width in nanometers
% NPoints is the number of points in the x grid
%
% Outputs: x is the grid for the plot, measured in nanometers
% psi is the normalized wave function
% E is the energy of the state in electron-volts
% Make the x-grid
xmin = 0;
xmax = a;
x = linspace(xmin,xmax,NPoints);
% Wave number for this energy level
k = n * pi / a;
% Calculate the wave function
psi = sqrt(2/a) * sin(k*x);
global hbar m
% Calculate energy in electron-volts
E = n^2*pi^2*hbar^2 / (2*m*(a*1e-9)^2) / 1.6e-19;
